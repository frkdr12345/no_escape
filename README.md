# no_escape
a simple minecraft mod.
use mcreator 2024.1


unzip and put the file in C:\MCreatorWorkspaces


A little information about the mode:

Pressing j should cause the screen to shake/change size and the player's camera to shake in the z direction

this mod creates fake players in the game and you can see them both by pressing tab and commands like /tp

in this mode, when you type help(thanks for @Ã¶mer2714. ) or is that all? in chat, some procedures should work according to the message you write
